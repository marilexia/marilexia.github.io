      <div class="about-me-caption"><p>
        My love for coding began when I took <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byrAED4BObk"><b><i>a leap of faith</i></b></a> and applied for 
        <a href="https://www.kodewithklossy.com/"><b><i>Kode with Klossy</i></b></a>, 
        a two-week computer science summer camp for girls in 2016. I came into camp still in fear from 
        just stepping out of my comfort zone but I was warmly welcomed into this community of girls who 
        share the same interests. In just two weeks, we had built friendships that last, developed the same 
        passions and successfully deployed our <a href="https://womenindustry.herokuapp.com/"><b>web applications</b></a>! After that first camp, I realized that I found 
        coding fun and it is something that I really liked doing so I applied for the next level the following year! <br><br>

        For Kode with Klossy's third year (2018), I am excited to share that I was one of the selected 
        teacher assistants for their summer camps in 25 different locations! I was honored to witness a 
        lot of girls' first line of code and was happy to help them in their coding journey! <br><br>

        Now, I am happy to share that I have been working to get my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
        Kode with Klossy opened many doors for me, and I couldn't be more grateful! I am excited to share my 
        coding superpowers to the world!
